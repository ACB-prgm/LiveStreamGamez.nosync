# LiveStream Gamez
OLD [Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p7jGhb4sBw) as of 08/06/21

A little project for all things live stream related.  Currently, there is a functioning chat scraping system that gets the chat feed from your live stream in real time! There is now a system in place so that viewers are given xp for interacting with the livestream! In the works right now is the ability to customize how you appear on stream (which is very close to completion). Next will be Godotgatchis â€” a little avatar that you customize that runs around the live stream screen when you are present! You unlock different ways to customize yourself by leveling up which you do by interacting with the stream!

### For people looking to fork this repo for their own use:
In order for the youtube OAuth2.0 to work, you will need to go to the "credentials" tab of your [google developer console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (free to make an account) and download the client_secrets.json file.  Then put this into the [OAuth2.0 directory](https://github.com/ACB-prgm/LiveStreamGamez.nosync/tree/master/ProjectFiles/OAuth2).
