# LiveStream Gamez
current [Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p7jGhb4sBw) as of 08/06/21

A little project for all things live stream related.  Currently, there is a functioning chat scraping system that gets the chat feed from your live stream in real time!

In order for the youtube OAuth2.0 to work, you will need to go to the "credentials" tab of your [google developer console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (free to make an account) and download the client_secrets.json file.  Then put this into the [OAuth2.0 directory](https://github.com/ACB-prgm/LiveStreamGamez.nosync/tree/master/ProjectFiles/OAuth2).
