# LiveStream Gamez
current [Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p7jGhb4sBw) as of 08/06/21

A little project for all things live stream related.  Currently, there is a functional task manager that outputs a YoutTube chapters list at the end of the stream (just copy&paste to your description), as well as a functions chat scraping system that gets your the chat feed from your lives stream in real time!  It currently does not work on export, but I think this is just because I dont understand how to use venv's with python, so I should iron that out eventually!

In order for the youtube OAuth2.0 to work, you will need to go the "credentials" tab of your [google developer console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (free to make account), and download the client_secrets.json file.  Then put this into the [OAuth2.0 directory](https://github.com/ACB-prgm/LiveStreamGamez.nosync/tree/master/ProjectFiles/OAuth2).
